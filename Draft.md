Good Points:
OpenZeppelin Basic Contracts: The use of OpenZeppelin’s ERC20, AccessControl, and ReentrancyGuard is solid for ensuring security, modularity, and preventing reentrancy attacks.
Access Control System: Roles like PHASE_ADMIN_ROLE, TOKEN_MINTER_ROLE, and TOKEN_BURNER_ROLE provide well-defined access, making the contract modular and easily governable.

Areas to Improve:
********************************************

Struct Usage for User Giveaways:

Current: Each user's giveaway is managed via a struct (UserPhaseData) that stores both tokenAmount and claimed status.
Improvement: Instead of using a struct, you can simply maintain an internal balance for each user. This reduces the complexity and gas costs involved in storing and updating multiple values. The backend can increase the balance directly, and the user decreases it when claiming rewards. This simplifies the gas-expensive process of claiming and reduces storage costs.
Example: public userInternal mapping(address => uint256) then toClaim = uint256 userInternal[userWallet] ) could be used to track each user's internal balance.
---------------------------------------------

Mass Distributions via Backend:

Current: The backend updates token amounts for each user, but users still have to call a separate claimRewards function, incurring additional gas.
Improvement: The backend can directly distribute tokens to users without them needing to claim. Instead of updating a user's internal balance and then having them claim, the backend could transfer the tokens directly, saving gas by eliminating the extra claimRewards call.
This, however, shifts more gas costs to the backend, so the trade-off needs to be considered based on your use case. If you plan having non user crypto, it might be easier to send them tokens without them buying crypto and interacting with a smart contract (just need to install metamask lets say). They could be then more incentived since they received something without spending and with less efforts (creating a wallet still needed but better than also needing to buy crypto)
---------------------------------------------

Storing Phase Tokens in Contract:

Current: Tokens to be distributed in each phase are stored with the contract’s owner address, which requires a transfer from the owner to users upon claiming.
Improvement: Store the tokens in the contract itself, making the token distribution process more gas-efficient and straightforward. This way, when tokens are awarded, they come directly from the contract rather than needing approval or transfer from the owner.
Also much more secure since its not an Externally Owned Address (EOA).
---------------------------------------------

User Data Struct Optimization:

Current: The UserPhaseData struct stores tokenAmount and claimed status. Both are stored separately for each phase.
Improvement: Track only the token amount and eliminate the claimed status if it's no longer necessary under the direct distribution model. If you want to show on your app all the time backend gave tokens to the user, just use an event in the smart contract or even store in a local database each time the backend call the contract to give token. Can store lets say with the tweet data, detected address in it and still display to the user in the app without the need of web3.
---------------------------------------------

Redundant Functions:

Functions like getTokenAmountsByAddress return arrays of data. While useful, consider whether these functions are needed in their current form, as fetching such large datasets on-chain can be gas-intensive (also deploying it).
You can also call any public variables or mappings from a contract without a function (example : userInternal[phase][userWallet] = uint256) and even query all events (lets say claims) user made if you decide to use events.
---------------------------------------------

Use phaseLimit if = 0 mean its closed, can also be used as validPhase trigger

********************************************
Short Explanation:
By eliminating structs where unnecessary and optimizing token distribution, you can significantly reduce gas costs. Using internal balances for users and distributing tokens directly during batch updates, along with storing phase tokens within the contract, will simplify the architecture and lower the overall transaction fees. Removing the need for users to claim rewards and optimizing the phase and user data tracking will lead to more streamlined operations.
********************************************

My conclusion is mostly fixing the owner() EOA holding the to-be-distributed tokens, using mapping instead struct for phase and user phase data and
